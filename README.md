# ENGG3000 – Automated Bridge Control System

This repository documents my contributions to an ENGG3000 systems engineering project involving the design and implementation of an **automated bridge control system** using an ESP32 microcontroller.

---

## 🚧 Project Overview

The system intelligently detects approaching **boats and vehicles** using ultrasonic sensors and autonomously controls a **motorised bridge lift mechanism**. Safety is ensured through coordinated **LED and traffic light signalling**, with additional **Wi-Fi-based monitoring and manual override** functionality.

The project integrates:
- Embedded systems
- Sensor calibration
- Finite State Machine (FSM) control logic
- Hardware–software co-design

---

## 🧩 My Role & Contributions

- Firmware testing and validation on ESP32
- FSM timing and safety interlock implementation
- Ultrasonic sensor calibration and threshold tuning
- End-to-end system validation against Technical Performance Measures (TPMs)
- Burn-in and reliability testing (50+ operational cycles)
- Technical documentation and testing evidence
