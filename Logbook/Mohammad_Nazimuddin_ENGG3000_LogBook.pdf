Week 1
Date: Week 1, 2025
------------------------------------------------------------
Today I continued my work on the automated bridge system. This week involved refining
and testing the ESP32-based control system, which integrates ultrasonic sensors, motor
drivers, and Wi-Fi communication. I recorded detailed notes, calibration data, and
troubleshooting outcomes. Faced issues with inconsistent sensor readings and PWM speed
control; resolved through code debugging, power stabilization, and fine-tuning the FSM
logic. Performed validation testing across multiple open/close cycles to confirm TPM
targets, especially focusing on motor load handling, Wi-Fi reliability, and response delay.
Sketch Placeholder: 🖼 (Bridge control wiring and FSM diagram to be hand-drawn). Next
week, plan to enhance system documentation, verify full test results, and assist with
integration for final demonstration.

Date: Week 13, 2025
Today marked our final presentation and demonstration day. I focused on preparing
the system for live operation, running the bridge automation cycle multiple times to
ensure consistent motor lift speed, LED signalling, and Wi-Fi dashboard response. Before
the demo, I recalibrated the sensors and verified all TPM evidence was ready for
submission. During the presentation, our ESP32-controlled system performed smoothly
— the bridge lifted and lowered within the 5-second target, traffic lights synchronised
perfectly, and all safety interlocks functioned as designed.
I felt proud seeing months of work run seamlessly in real time and appreciated how every
subsystem came together into one cohesive demonstration.

Appendix C: Reflection Summary
Throughout this project, I strengthened my skills in embedded systems development,
debugging, and system integration. I learned to identify and solve electrical interference
issues, perform calibration with quantitative validation, and manage teamwork under strict
deadlines. Applying structured testing and design trade-offs improved not only the project
outcome but also my engineering judgment and confidence.
